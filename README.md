# Waste Wizard: Simplifying Your Waste Management Experience



Welcome to Waste Wizard, a comprehensive waste management solution developed to simplify waste management processes, promote recycling, and contribute to a cleaner environment. Waste Wizard was developed from February 2023 to May 2023 with the aim of having a positive impact on environmental preservation, public health, and economic efficiency.

## Features

### Waste Segregation Guidance
Waste Wizard provides users with guidance on how to effectively segregate different types of waste, promoting recycling and proper disposal practices. Through intuitive interfaces and informative content, users can learn about the importance of waste segregation and how to do it correctly.

### Real-time Notifications
Users receive real-time notifications for optimized waste collection routes, ensuring timely and efficient waste pickup. Waste Wizard utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze waste collection data and determine the most efficient routes for waste collection, reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact.

### Promoting Recycling and Resource Recovery
Waste Wizard includes features that encourage users to recycle and recover resources. By providing information on recycling centers, donation facilities, and composting sites, Waste Wizard empowers users to take proactive steps towards waste reduction and resource conservation.

### Integration with Firebase
The application securely stores user data, facilitates real-time communication, and efficiently handles user feedback and rewards through Firebase integration. User data is encrypted and protected, ensuring privacy and security for all users. Real-time communication features enable seamless interaction between users and waste management authorities, facilitating quick response to user queries and concerns.

## Algorithm

Waste Wizard utilizes various algorithms to enhance its functionality:

- **Routing Algorithms:** Optimizes waste collection routes to minimize time and resources spent on waste pickup, potentially utilizing algorithms like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- **Recommendation Algorithms:** Suggests recycling or waste disposal tips based on user behavior or preferences, enhancing user engagement and promoting sustainable practices.
- **Image Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for image recognition to assist in waste segregation guidance, allowing users to identify different types of waste through images.
